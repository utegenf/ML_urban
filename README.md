# Urban Sound Classification with neural networks
We can naturally recognize any sounds, however how cool it would be if computer systems could also identify various sounds and classify them into categories. One of the most extensively utilized applications in Audio Deep Learning is Sound Classification. It entails learning to classify sounds and predict which group they belong to. This sort of task may be utilized in a variety of circumstances, such as categorizing music clips to determine the genre of music or classifying brief utterances by a group of speakers to identify the speaker based on the voice. The main goal of this experimental project is using Deep Learning algorithms to teach a computer how to identify environmental sounds and by what criteria they should be divided into categories. 

# Dataset: 
For this experimental project, I am going to use the UrbanSound8K dataset that consists of a corpus of ordinary sounds recorded from day-to-day city life. The given sounds are collected from 10 classes such as: 
*<br>Children playing    -    1000
<br>Dog bark             -    1000
<br>Street music         -    1000
<br>Jackhammer           -    1000
<br>Engine Idling        -    1000
<br>Air Conditioner      -    1000
<br>Drilling             -    1000
<br>Siren                -    929
<br>Car Horn             -    429
<br>Gun Shot             -    374*
